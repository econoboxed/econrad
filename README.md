This is a small blog engine I wrote to run my personal website, [econrad.org](econrad.org).

This project requires a funcitoning LAMP stack, uses Bootstrap's CSS and JS libraries, and uses Web Deploy for CI.\
Articles are saved in a mySQL database, and populated as thumbnails on index.php, and shown in full in articles.php.
